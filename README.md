# Totelly Organized
### Front End Capstone Project | November 2020
An app for whole home organization. We've all had that moment... we KNOW we have those red fuzzy socks but where could they be?! With totelly organized, users can easily keep track of and lookup items within their homes, storage units etc. Users can also share locations with other users (spouse, children etc) while keeping other locations seperate. 

## Project Goals: 
* Help users quickly locate that extra pair of headphones they know they put somewhere but haven't seen in months.
* Strengthen data relationship knowledge
* Improve my ReactJS skillset while learning about different NPM packages & Component Libraries. 

## Instructions
* Clone Repo onto local machine
* run `npm install` in the totelly-organized root directory
* start JSON Server by typing the following command into terminal from totelly-organized api folder: `json-server -p 8088 -w database.json`
* run `npm start` to view application in browser. 
* Begin by registering an account as a new user. User data will remain on your local machine. 

Note: login & register is not secure & should be used for demo purposes only.
